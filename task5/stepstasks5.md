+ # STEPS HOW GITHUB WORKS :
+ ## Github builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories,where development can outline requirements and direction and set 
+ *expectations for team members. Then using Github flow developers create a branch to work on updates ,commit changes to save them,open pull requests to propose and discuss changes,and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.*
●Some of process involved in github working are :
A. Create a branch: Topic branches created from canonical deployment branch allows teams to contribute to many parallel efforts.
B.Forking: when you fork a repository,you create a copy of the original repository but it remains on github.
C.Clone: when you clone a repository it is copied on to your local machine with help of git.
D.Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe ,revertible points in project history.
E.PR : pull requests publicize a project's ongoing efforts and set tone for a transparent development process.
F.Discuss and review code:Teams participate in code reviews by commenting,testing,and reviewing open pull requests.
G.Merge: Upon clicking merge Github automatically performs the equivalent of local merge operation. Github also  keeps the entire branch development history on merged pull requests.
H.Opening issues: use issues to track ideas ,enhancements ,tasks,or bugs for work on Github .We can collect user feedback ,report software bugs,and organize tasks you’d like to accomplish with issues in a repository.It is a place to report software bugs.
